QUESTION ANSWERS

1) In working with active record, AR created the following methods for us:
    Student.all
2) I had to create the following methods:
    Student#full_name
    Student@grade_level --- This method could also be achieved by simply calling on student.grade, given by AR
    Student.all_in_grade
    Teacher#tenure?
